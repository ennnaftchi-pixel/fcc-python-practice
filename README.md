# FreeCodeCamp Python Practice

This repository contains Python exercises completed as part of **FreeCodeCamp's curriculum and certificate programs**. The focus is on **practical learning**, applying Python concepts, and developing problem-solving skills through small projects and exercises.

## About This Repository

Exercises in this repository were completed while following FreeCodeCamp's Python curriculum. The goal is to **practice Python concepts in real exercises**, rather than just theory.  

Projects and scripts demonstrate **learning in action** and reflect my **early journey in Python programming**. Each exercise is self-contained, includes comments and docstrings explaining the purpose, and can be run independently.

## Curriculum Overview

The FreeCodeCamp Python course teaches the fundamentals of Python programming. To earn the Python certification, learners must:

- Complete the required projects to qualify for the certification exam  
- Pass the Python Certification exam  

Core topics in the course include:

- Python Basics  
- Loops and Sequences  
- Dictionaries and Sets  
- Error Handling  
- Classes and Objects / OOP  
- Linear Data Structures  
- Algorithms  
- Graphs and Trees  
- Dynamic Programming

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a **learning journal**. It shows the exercises and small projects I completed while following the FreeCodeCamp Python curriculum.  

It is **primarily for learning and experimentation**, so code may not always be polished. Larger, refined projects will be separated into their own repositories.
