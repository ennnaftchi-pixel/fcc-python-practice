## About This Repository

Exercises in this repository were completed while following FreeCodeCamp's Python curriculum. The goal is to **practice Python concepts in real exercises**, rather than just theory.  

Topics covered include:

- Data types and structures (`list`, `dict`, `str`, `int`)  
- Input validation  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Functions and modular design  
- Basic file handling and error checking  
- Using regular expressions for data validation  

Projects and scripts demonstrate **learning in action** and reflect my **early journey in Python programming**. Each exercise is self-contained, includes comments and docstrings explaining the purpose, and can be run independently.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a **learning journal**. It shows the exercises and small projects I completed while following the FreeCodeCamp Python curriculum.  

It is **primarily for learning and experimentation**, so code may not always be polished. Larger, refined projects will be separated into their own repositories.
